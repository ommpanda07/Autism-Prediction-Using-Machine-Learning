🧠 Autism Prediction using Machine Learning 🤖

This project aims to predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using advanced Machine Learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost 🌟.
It combines data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation to help identify potential ASD cases efficiently and accurately.

🚀 Features & Workflow

✨ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and fixes inconsistencies.
📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizes key patterns and correlations using Matplotlib & Seaborn.
⚖️ SMOTE for Class Balancing – Solves imbalance issues to improve prediction fairness.
🧠 Model Building – Trains Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers.
🎯 Hyperparameter Tuning – Uses RandomizedSearchCV to find the best model configuration.
📈 Model Evaluation – Reports accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.
💾 Model Saving – Saves the best model as best_model.pkl and encoders for reuse.
