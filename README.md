# Autism Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.

## Steps
- Data preprocessing & encoding
- SMOTE for class balancing
- Model tuning using RandomizedSearchCV
- Best model saved as `best_model.pkl`
